# Workflow Background

Here we cover the background / general idea of the PWA workflow as seen in [simpsonprofilewise2023](@cite). We also introduce the idea of reference tolerance sets for predictions of realisations/observations within the workflow as formally introduced in my [Masters thesis](https://github.com/JoelTrent/UoA_MastersWorking).

This is a summary of the content in my [Masters thesis](https://github.com/JoelTrent/UoA_MastersWorking).

This summary uses models of the form 'deterministic mathematical model + error model' as in [simpsonprofilewise2023](@cite) and [murphyimplementing2023](@cite), but it can also be used with stochastic models [simpsonreliable2022](@cite).
