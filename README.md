TO DO

An implementation and exploration of the [likelihood-based profile-wise analysis workflow](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011515) from Matthew Simpson and Oliver Maclaren.

The API is largely stable, but but shouldn't be regarded as fixed until the first version is released; the package will be kept as v1.0.0-DEV until then. The main work remaining is in completing documentation. However, one of the bivariate boundary methods may be removed.

A package developed to fulfil the requirements of a Masters of Engineering at The University of Auckland by Joel Trent between March 2023 and February 2024. 

Supervised by Oliver Maclaren, Ruanui Nicholson and Matthew Simpson.
